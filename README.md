# Jumping-Robot-with-Constraints / Pumping Robot / Balancing

This branch has been created to explore balancing using LQR

To make this as easy as possible, constraints were removed and the robot was described as a three dof system in the x-direction CoM coordinate frame.  The function `derive_equations_JR.m` shows the derivation and explains some things about linearization.  The function `main.m` explains a bit about LQR.  Additional slides and/or video will follow.
